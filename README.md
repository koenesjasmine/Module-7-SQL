# Employee Retirement Analysis
## Overview 
Pewlett-Hackard is seeking to construct a data set composed of about 6 CSV files containing employee information, they want to determine the number of employees per title with tenure for a mentorship program, as well as expecting attrition rates with employees retiring they may need to be able to fill the positions lost, with well trained, mentored new hire employees. 
## Analysis and Results
The files recieved that Pewlett-Hackard is wanting us to compile into 1 set of data include records of Employees (over 300K records), Salaries (over 300k records), Titles (over 440k records), Departments (9 records), Department Managers (25 records), and Department Employees (over 330K records) With this information we were able to provide the following information.
> First we start with total current employees, over 200K

> Second we move to retirement eligible employees based on title, and department; roughly 70K

## Conclusion
Based on current standing for mentor qualifications, the ratio of new hires to mentors is 40:1, that's more than the averge sized classroom in the Unitied States. We suggest broadening the eligibility requirements for mentorship as there may not be enough employees that are able to fill the mentorship position prior to retirement wave of attrition. Developing a graph with years of experience would be helpful to determine the range of availability and eligibility of potentional members.
